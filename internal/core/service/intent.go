// createIntentLease is an in-flight-create lease: an open file descriptor
// holding an exclusive flock(2) on the create-intent file for as long as the
// creating process is inside the create window.
//
// # Why a lease is needed
//
// CreateAndBoot materialises the per-sandbox disk (a multi-second cp for a
// multi-GiB image) BEFORE it commits the store record. During that window the
// disk exists with no record, and no process anywhere carries the ULID in its
// cmdline — cloud-hypervisor is not launched until after the record write — so
// the reaper's /proc liveness gate (reap.go, scanProcForULID) has nothing to
// match. Without a lease the reaper correctly concludes "no record, no live
// process" and unlinks the disk of a create that is still running.
//
// # Why flock
//
// The kernel releases flock(2) locks when the holding process dies, including
// on SIGKILL, and a reboot releases everything. So a dead creator can NEVER
// block reclamation: the next reaper acquires the lease and reclaims. That is
// the property that makes this safe to add to a reaper whose entire purpose is
// reclaiming leaked disks. It is the same primitive, and the same reasoning,
// that store.Lock already uses for sandbox records (see store/lock.go, "Crash
// safety guarantee" and "Lease equivalence").
//
// A lease is held from before the intent file is discoverable (see
// writeCreateIntent) until CreateAndBoot's deferred cleanup calls release,
// which happens after store.Create has committed the record. There is
// therefore no instant at which a create's disks are neither leased nor owned.

// Durability contract: the function performs a write→Sync→rename→dir-Sync
// sequence before returning. Both syncs are required for true power-loss
// durability:
//
//   - f.Sync() makes the file data durable (survives ext4 journal replay).
//   - dir.Sync() makes the directory entry durable so the reaper can discover
//     the file by scanning diskDir. Without the directory sync the inode may
//     survive a power loss while the directory entry does not, leaving the
//     reaper unable to find the intent and the orphaned disk invisible.
//
// Lease-before-visibility: the file is written under a staging name
// ("<ULID>.create-intent.json.tmp") and flocked BEFORE being renamed into
// place. The reaper's index matches only the exact ".create-intent.json"
// suffix (resource_index.go), so the staging name is invisible to it. The
// rename is atomic and carries the flock with the inode, so the intent becomes
// discoverable only in the already-leased state — there is no window in which
// a reaper can see an unleased intent for a live create.
//
// The descriptor deliberately stays open after this function returns: closing
// it would drop the lease. It is closed by release.
//
// The intent must be fully durable before cowExt4 materialises the .raw disk,
// or the failure window this function is designed to close simply moves.
// Callers (create.go) invoke writeCreateIntent before cowExt4; together the
// write+sync sequence inside this function and that call-site ordering make the
// contract hold.
//
// Residual limit: fsync guarantees are only as strong as the storage hardware
// and driver stack honour them. True power-loss behaviour is not tested here;
// see docs/site/operations/resource-lifecycle.md for the full durability contract
// and its unverified residuals.
