// # Reentrancy prohibition — self-deadlock hazard
//
// Driver methods are called while the nexus3 core holds the per-sandbox
// exclusive flock (store.Update acquires LOCK_EX and calls the substrate
// method inside the callback). Implementations MUST NOT call back into any
// nexus3 store method — store.Update, store.Delete, store.SetRemovalMarker,
// store.ClearRemovalMarker, or any other method that acquires that flock —
// because the flock is non-recursive: a second attempt from the same process
// to acquire a lock it already holds will deadlock, spinning forever while
// the goroutine waits for itself.
//
// Consequence: a re-entrant driver call deadlocks the sandbox permanently.
// The store.Lock.acquire loop only re-checks ctx on EINTR, so context
// cancellation does not reliably unblock the deadlocked goroutine.
//
// This is safe today only because no production code constructs a Recoverer
// and no real driver exists — cmd_recover.go refuses with "no substrate
// configured". Wiring a real Cloud Hypervisor or nexus3-vzd driver arms this
// hazard immediately. See motive.md for the recorded deferral.

	// identified by id. Recovery logic depends on this method being correct.

	// If the driver cannot determine the state it returns an Observation
	// with State == [Unknown] and a non-nil error. Callers must treat Unknown
	// as a failure to observe, never as [Absent]; conflating them is how a
	// live VM gets destroyed.
