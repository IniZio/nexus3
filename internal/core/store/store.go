// Store is the durable record layer for sandboxes. Multiple concurrent CLI
// invocations may read and write simultaneously; implementations must be safe
// under concurrent multi-process use.
//
// # State is a cache
// The State field stored on disk is a CACHE, not the truth. The substrate (the
// VMM) is authoritative; a later recovery pass reconciles stored records against
// the live substrate. No method on this interface implies that writing a state
// makes it canonical — callers should treat reads as advisory until reconciled.
//
// # In-flight operations and leases
// Transient operation states (cloning, forking, snapshotting, stopping,
// restoring) are deliberately absent from domain.State. An in-flight operation
// is represented as an exclusive flock held alongside the record — never as a
// state written into it. The kernel releases the flock automatically when the
// holding process dies (including SIGKILL), so a crashed operation cannot leave
// a sandbox stuck in a fake state. See lock.go for the crash-safety guarantee.

	// sandbox exists.

	// List returns all sandboxes whose records can be decoded by this binary.
	// A corrupt or unreadable individual record is silently skipped rather than
	// failing the entire list; this includes records written by a newer binary
	// (future schema version). An error is returned only if the root directory
	// itself cannot be read.

	// Update performs a read-modify-write of a sandbox record under an exclusive
	// per-sandbox flock, making concurrent CLI invocations safe. The callback
	// receives a pointer to the current record and may mutate it in place. If
	// the callback returns an error the record is not written. Returns
	// ErrNotFound if the sandbox does not exist.

	// SetRemovalMarker sets the write-ahead removal marker. It MUST be called
	// and must succeed before any destructive removal work begins. The required
	// ordering is:
	//
	//   SetRemovalMarker → destructive work (Delete)
	//
	// On successful removal, the marker dies with the record: Delete removes the
	// entire sandbox directory, including the marker, so nothing needs to clear
	// it afterward. If the process crashes after Set but before Delete, the
	// marker survives on disk. On the next recovery pass, a set marker on an
	// absent VM means removal was interrupted and is terminal: the sandbox must
	// be treated as gone and removal must not be retried. This mirrors Docker
	// writing a Dead state before its own destructive steps.
	SetRemovalMarker(ctx context.Context, id domain.SandboxID) error

	// ClearRemovalMarker clears the write-ahead removal marker. It is used
	// exclusively in the abandonment case: when recovery observes the marker set
	// but the VM is still alive, proving the removal did not complete and is no
	// longer in progress. Clearing the marker is correct only when the live
	// substrate proves removal did not occur — never call this after a successful
	// removal (the marker dies with the record via Delete in the normal path).
