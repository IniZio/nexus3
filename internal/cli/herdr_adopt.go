// herdrSpaceResolveOrAdopt resolves a space binding and, failing that, ADOPTS
// the sandbox by minting one.
//
// # Why adoption exists (TBR-PD-20)
//
// Listing a sandbox in herdr never needed a binding: `workspaces` calls
// svc.List unfiltered, so every sandbox shows up however it was created. But
// every ACTION — open-pane, pause, resume, remove — went through
// herdrSpaceResolve and dead-ended with "binding not found" for any sandbox
// created outside herdr. A sandbox made with `nexus3 sandbox create` was
// therefore visible and inert, which is the worst of both: it looks
// controllable and is not.
//
// Adoption is deliberately LAZY rather than eager. Binding at create time
// would mint a herdr workspace for every sandbox, including the throwaway ones
// that `nexus3 run` and the test suites produce, and would make core create
// depend on an external UI being installed. Doing it at first use costs
// nothing until someone actually asks herdr to act on the sandbox, and by
// definition herdr is running at that moment.
//
// # No herdr workspace is created here
//
// The adopted binding carries an EMPTY HerdrWorkspaceID. Pause, resume and
// remove only need the sandbox handle, and remove's herdrWorkspaceClose is a
// no-op on an empty ID. Only open-pane needs a real workspace, and it mints
// one lazily via herdrSpaceEnsureWorkspace. Minting one here would create
// empty workspaces every time someone paused a sandbox.
//
// Returns the binding and whether it was adopted (as opposed to found).
