// Package perimeter defines the shared types for nexus3's egress-filtering
// subsystem. It is the policy layer: it consumes a raw TAP fd produced by the
// driver transport layer and enforces per-sandbox egress policy.
//
// Dependency direction (hard constraint):
//
//	driver (transport) → fd → perimeter (policy)
//
// The perimeter package MUST NOT import internal/core/driver. The driver may
// not import perimeter. The fd flows one way: driver creates it, perimeter
// consumes it via the driver.NetworkHook capability (discovered by the caller
// via type assertion — the caller imports both packages).
