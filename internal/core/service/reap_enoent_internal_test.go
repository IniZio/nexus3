// TBD-PD-37, idempotency half. A resource that vanished between enumeration
// and deletion is a SUCCESSFUL reclamation — another reaper or a concurrent
// `sandbox rm` finished the job — and must not be reported as a failure.
//
// If it were, two reapers racing would each exit non-zero on work that
// completed correctly, and operators would learn to ignore the exit code,
// which is the one signal TBD-PD-37 exists to make trustworthy.
//
// This lives in the internal test package because the window it needs cannot
// be produced by arranging real files: Reap enumerates first and deletes
// second, so a file removed beforehand is never enumerated at all.
