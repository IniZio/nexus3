// Package recovery reconciles persisted sandbox records against the live
// substrate at CLI invocation time.
//
// # The governing rule
//
// The substrate is authoritative. The stored record is a cache. Where a live
// VM disagrees with the stored state, the VM wins. [Recoverer.recoverByID]
// calls [driver.Driver.Observe] before consulting any stored field; the
// ordering is structural, not incidental, and is enforced by the exclusive
// per-sandbox flock that spans the entire observe → decide → write sequence.
//
// # Concurrency safety — per-sandbox exclusive lock
//
// [Recoverer.recoverByID] holds the per-sandbox exclusive flock for the
// entire observe → decide → write sequence by running inside a single
// [store.Store.Update] callback. Driver.Observe is called first, inside the
// callback. Every branch on stored state is therefore downstream of both the
// substrate observation and the lock acquisition, which prevents a concurrent
// [service.Service.Start] from committing a live VM state between the
// observation and the record write.
//
// The lock is per-sandbox (one flock file per sandbox directory). Recovering
// N sandboxes acquires N independent flocks — never all at once — so recovery
// does not serialise into a single global bottleneck.
//
// # Reentrancy constraint
//
// [driver.Driver.Observe] is called while the per-sandbox exclusive flock is
// held. The [driver.Driver] interface prohibits re-entrant store calls from
// within a driver method; a re-entrant call would deadlock because the flock
// is non-recursive. See the Driver interface doc for the full prohibition.
//
// # Ordering invariant
//
// The substrate-first ordering is guaranteed by the flock: Observe runs inside
// the exclusive Update callback, so every decision branch on rec fields is
// downstream of both the observation and the lock acquisition. The staleness
// hazard is eliminated rather than merely reordered: the substrate is always
// queried before any stored field is consulted, and under the lock no
// concurrent writer can change the record between observation and write.
//
// # Corrupt records
//
// [store.Store.List] silently skips sandbox directories with corrupt or
// unreadable record.json files (interrupted creates, future-schema records,
// JSON parse errors). That silent skip IS the "report it and continue"
// guarantee for this package: a corrupt entry never reaches [Recoverer.Recover]
// and therefore never blocks recovery of healthy sandboxes. No additional
// handling is needed at this layer.
